# Graph Report - codex_pro  (2026-09-12)

## Corpus Check
- cluster-only mode — file stats not available

## Summary
- 9 nodes · 5 edges · 4 communities (1 shown, 1 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 100% EXTRACTED · 0% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS
- Token cost: 0 input · 0 output

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `a545e048`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Community Hubs (Navigation)
- Community 0
- Community 1

## God Nodes (most connected - your core abstractions)
1. `private` - 1 edges
2. `Application entry point.` - 1 edges

## Surprising Connections (you probably didn't know these)
- None detected - all connections are within the same source files.

## Import Cycles
- None detected.

## Communities (4 total, 1 thin omitted)

### Community 0 - "Community 0"
Cohesion: 0.50
Nodes (3): name, private, version

## Knowledge Gaps
- **3 isolated node(s):** `name`, `private`, `version`
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components. (Counts symbols only; 7 node(s) total have ≤1 connection when file, concept and rationale nodes are included.)
- **1 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **What connects `name`, `private`, `version` to the rest of the system?**
  _3 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
